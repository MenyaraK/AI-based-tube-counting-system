# PVC Pipe Delivery Optimization System

## Overview
In the industrial sector, the need for automation and optimization of logistical processes is crucial for maintaining a reliable and efficient supply chain. This project addresses the manual verification of PVC pipe deliveries, which is time-consuming and prone to human error.

Leveraging the Intel RealSense D35i depth camera and the Raspberry Pi, this project aims to automate the verification process by developing a mobile application using Flutter. The system captures images of delivery trucks, analyzes them to count the PVC pipes, and cross-verifies the results with delivery invoices to identify discrepancies.

## Features
- **User Management**: Create accounts and log in securely.
- **Camera Integration**: Select and use the Intel RealSense D35i for capturing images.
- **Invoice Management**: Link delivery invoices for cross-verification.
- **Image Capture and Processing**: Capture truck images and process them to count PVC pipes.
- **Results Display**: View analysis results and identify any discrepancies with invoices.
- **Notifications**: Receive status updates for image processing.
